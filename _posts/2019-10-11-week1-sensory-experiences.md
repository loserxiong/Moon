### 1. Introduction

This was my first project of master degree. It was a open and free project. We were given one week time to design an experience that centres on human senses based on a tour between four places.

### 2. Generate ideas

To start with, we formed  a group of four people(Alex, Zain, Tracie and me). In order to recall the experience we had that day. Each of us printed several pictures we took that day and made a map. It acted like a mood board that can reflect our feelings at that time.

After that, we came out with four major feelings. 1. A confused feeling when seeing the rocks near the pier. 2. A contrast feeling when seeing different people recognize the sand in different ways. 3. A crowded and suffocate feeling when first climbing the monument and finally feel open and comfortable. 4. A mysterious feeling in the Mithraeum.

### 3. Process

So we tried to present theses four experience or  feelings. We reached an agreement that we can address these feelings in a common form, which is a box. For my part, I tried to use optical illusion effect to express the contrast feeling. If people observe the box from different angle, they would see different objects instead.

We shared this initial idea with professor John. He really dislike it and taught us a new word ''clunky'' which he used to rate our ideas. He thought the way we want to express our idea is too abstract. We should use different sensory as much as possible. Instead of telling our feelings, we need to reproduce our experience to let others feel about it.

So after the tutorial, we decided to change our plan and focused on one specific feelings. The monument became our main target.

Our group member Tracie described her feeling like this:

"At first, it is hot and muggy at the bottom of the monument and also the window is small. There is a spiral staircase to climb which is very narrow. People need to stop and give each other some spaces for them to pass by. As I climbed higher and higher, it getting brighter, and the air becomes fresh. Finally when I reach the top, it was open and there was mind blowing." 

We wanted to reproduce the perception of air, space and light at that situation. I drew a graph to show the level of these three things. After that, we came out with several plans.

Firstly, we wanted our users to wear several mask. By taking them off one by one to simulate the changes of air. But it comes out that we cannot simulate the light in this plan.

As to the plan B, We considered to create something like Russian doll. We wanted to put a piles of boxes over the head and take them down one by one. But this also had the disadvantage of can't stimulate the light.

And the Plan C is like a toilet roll paper. we operate it by pulling the rolled up cardboard. However, we find that the space inside doesn't change as we pulling out the cardboard. So it fails as well.

Plan D is our final choice. it had great improvement in both aspect. It acted like a helmet. The helmet is filled with 12 partitions. For experiencing, the users need to put on the helmet and rotate it slowly, which means that he is now climbing the monument. As you rotate it slowly,  you can feel the space growing inside. We are going to take the partitions out one by one. Through the gap, you can feel the environment around you is getting brighter and brighter, you can breathe in more air and breathe more smoothly. And finally when all the partitions are removed, you can get a whole scene of the city through the joy of successfully boarding the monument.

### 4. conclusion

We didn't finish our presentation this time because we wrongly arranged the time of presentation. We don't need to talk much about our thinking process. One of the biggest drawbacks of our installations is that it takes some time to reassemble and so that it can't be experienced by everyone. Our classmate commented that it is better if the whole device can work automatic instead of four people pulling together. All the feedback is quite valuable and I got to know how others think about our work. 

This is our first project and I quite enjoy the whole process. Hope we can do better next time.
