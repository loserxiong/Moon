# Desk Research

After reorienting ourselves, we conducted desktop research on this topic. Should we go out under the epidemic? how should we go out properly? And what is the experience of going out? This is something that we are all experiencing.

We started by trying to find out the answer to the question we've always had, which is how long will the epidemic stay with us? We tried to find the answer by looking at the literature and forecasts.

According to this analysis by McKinney (Charumilind, 2021) , looking only at the United States, it is expected that the end of the epidemic or herd immunity of the epidemic may not be reached in the United States until the third or fourth quarter of 2021 at the earliest, but this also relies on the combination of a vaccine with public health measures, effective promotion of new treatments and diagnostics, and the benefits of seasonality. This is also supported by the BBC report (Gallagher, 2021) , which notes that of the three means by which an epidemic can be gotten rid of: an epidemic, enough people infected to produce antibodies, and a complete change in one's behavior, vaccines take at least 12-18 months, while herd immunity takes at least two years to develop. At this point, it appears that we need to change our behavior over time to keep the infection rate at a very low level. Keeping social distance and wearing a good mask are commonly used options at this time.

Combined with the recent frequent resurgence of outbreaks, we have reason to believe that the virus may still be with us for a longer period of time. So we wondered if this unusual period of travel could lead to certain problems.

The masks drew our attention first, the supplies that were widely used from the very beginning of the epidemic in the limelight to now.As summarized by the article by National Center for Biotechnology Information (Shanay, 2020), masks have been widely recognized as an effective means of stopping the spread of the virus, while almost all countries around the world are in favor of using masks in public places. In addition, some Asian countries, such as Japan and Singapore, even adopted the practice of mandatory mask use at the beginning of the outbreak. Thus, the use of masks in public, as an important hygiene measure, may become a new norm after the new coronavirus pandemic. It has also been argued that masks are a necessity to defeat the virus, and cases have shown that people in elevators can be infected by an infected person within seconds without any direct contact. Grocery stores are another good example in the article. Masks are effective in preventing person-to-person infections by stopping droplet transmission (Zhai, 2020).

But the mask, as a basic protective measure, needs to cover the user's nose and mouth. The traditional way of communication that relies on facial expressions is immediately interrupted. Non-verbal communication has become increasingly difficult due to the widespread use of masks. "Today, masks have become semi-permanent accessories for the face, impeding our ability to express and perceive each other's facial expressions by dividing them into a visible upper half and an invisible lower half. ” (Nestor, 2020) The difficulty of using the remaining half to understand the emotions of the person we are talking to has increased. "For thousands of pieces, we have been communicating using nonverbal means (Chen, Crivelli, Garrod, Fernandez-Dols, 2014)” Because most masks cover the lower half of the face, it becomes significantly more difficult to recognize positive emotions (such as happiness or friendliness) in the person wearing the mask, which are primarily conveyed through smiling. A real or authentic smile, also known as a Duchenne smile, uses both the lower half of the face and the upper half of the face. And recognizing and responding to external displays of emotion from peers is a critical and necessary component of social interaction, as it helps individuals to change their behavior to align with social communication and behavioral norms (Mandal, 2014). Thus, it can be seen that new problems were created when the mask, as a special health care item, suddenly appeared in everyday life.

This is not only a great distraction for peers, but as the article recounts, in the field of medicine "nonverbal communication is the most effective means of communication for establishing contact with people with dementia  (Mathias, 2020)" and body language skills will be retained in them longer than verbal skills. Many patients are highly dependent on such nonverbal skills. Likewise, the article mentions that for doctors and nurses, nonverbal communication enhances patients' perceptions of sincerity and dedication and competence, improving the doctor-patient relationship.

Maintaining social distance, another widely promoted method of epidemic mitigation, appears to be more subdued in perception and less costly to implement. But there is also much controversy. Michael Kimmelman (2020) argues that ”our response [to the ‘anti-urban’ forces of the pandemic] so far – social distancing – … runs up against our fundamental desires to interact”.  So far, you can very easily socially find cases of keeping social distance. For example, Domino Park in Brooklyn, where they have painted 8-foot wide circles on the ground to encourage people to keep a safe distance. Or a restaurant in Sweden has added a small greenhouse above each seat to ensure that the right distance is maintained. Large supermarkets set limits on the number of people allowed to enter, more than the number of customers need to wait in line outside.

This is not without some laughable cases, such as a cafe in Schwerin, Germany, which gave some of these hats to its customers to encourage them to keep a safe distance. The Romanian shoemaker, Grigor Lupu, who makes long leather shoes about equal to a British size 31, wanted this method to separate people to ensure social distance. A man in the UK, made his own giant social distance machine which carried him on his head and walked down the street to demonstrate the range of social distance in the most visual way.

However the negative effects of social distance are also very significant. Scholars in Indonesia investigated how social distance during the new crown epidemic would affect students, and according to the survey, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on students performing physical distance. Students feared exposure to CO-19, their ability to perform daily activities was reduced, and nearly half of the respondents experienced moderate to severe anxiety（Ardan, 2020）. As Joe Cortright (2020) claims, “When cities work well, it’s because, in all their spaces, they overcome or bridge social distance … The reason we find social distancing so difficult, and so off-putting is that it runs counter to so much of what makes life, especially city life, worthwhile.”

In general, humans as social animals need to interact with other people. But external measures such as masks and social distance force behavior change, and "human behavior is subject to a triadic interaction of behavioral, personal, and environmental factors. Among these, environmental factors play a decisive role." （Baharom, 2020）In this particular period, both behavior and environment were largely influenced.

Some countries have made them mandatory as a widely used method, but over time, the potential impact of these measures and to what extent they will affect communication remains unknown. It is clear that these issues have not received widespread attention and the pitfalls of being in this state for a long time are in a highly unknown state.

The unknowns in between piqued our interest and we wanted to dig further for this situation.
