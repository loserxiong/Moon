To be honest, my life has been completely hijacked by the mobile phone. When Apple introduced screen time function, I am so surprised to find out that  I use my phone for 8 hours a day on average. Although I really enjoy the convenience brought by mobile phones, Such a long use time is obviously unacceptable. Not to mention that this hasn't counted the time spent on iPad and computer. I aware  that I became a slave of my phone.

There is no doubt that mobile phone strongly changed our way of living. But how we use it or how often we use it is a big question. sometimes when I spend too many time on my phone, I feel very boring. But this is the easiest way to get happiness and satisfaction, which is not real. I even used to play  phones and refused to go for a walk with my parents.

With the rapid development of 5G internet, our lives will inevitably lean towards these screens. Data fee becomes really cheap. There is one more skill list that modern people must master to learn, which is how to balance the time spent on the screen with the time in real life.

Earlier, I tried to reduce the time I use my phone. Now I managed to use 4 hours a day on average. I feel way better. It is really important to drop your phone and fully experience this world. Don't let the phone take up the time that belong to us.
