After the presentation, the feedback we received was that our literature review was too sloppy and considered too one-sided. At the same time, the number is insufficient. So we decided to perfect our literature review and each of us went to find an article that we found useful.

This is indeed very useful, everyone found some interesting materials and provided new ideas. I have read a lot of interesting articles, among which I think I have gained a lot is an article called Unruly Women and Carnivalesque Countercontrol: Offensive Humor in Mediated Social Protest. This article analyzes the humor in the protest, I have summarized the following points.

-At the women’s march in January 2018. In order to vent anger, many protest posters featured offensive jokes at the expense of Trump’s body, mocking his “comb over” hairstyle, his small hands, his orange taint, and so on. 
-Such posters were often spotted at protests and shared widely online.
-There is also concern that it remains inefficient or even antithetical to meaningful sociopolitical change
-Examples：they use “DACA DACA TINY COCK-A” slogan. Trump’s child-like behavior violates dominant assumptions about the rational, male agent in the political public sphere, and it can be argued that it is exactly these kinds of transgressions that Trump’s opponents experience as offensive, and which in turn mobilize them to protest and give offense back.
-some people suggest that such charged political online humor can mobilize people and serve as “a pre-political gateway to future civic engagement”

-The contradictory nature of offensive humor holds these circulating online images in tension, thereby enabling what Reilly and Boler (2014) call “prepolitization”—a novel form of civic participation that can mobilize citizens who would not otherwise explicitly participate in civic life, thereby creating new political sensibilities and desires.
-It can be an effective tool for drawing attention to situations of injustice, for binding people together against formal power structures of authority, and for carving out a space for empowering feelings of 2 Journal of countercontrol, which are necessary ingredients for social and political change

I find this article very instructive, it tells us we shoulf choose humorous expressions carefully to avoid being offensive and humor can function as a mobilizing force, without glossing over its limitations in the realm of civic engagement. 

After that, Carol and Jiayi also analyzed the content posted on XR social media, regarding the words used in their slogans and the types of protests. At this stage, we actually backed up our progress a bit. We were too fast before and many things didn't come and think. This time we returned to the literature review stage, but we got many interesting ideas.

In the next step, we started to come up with a more alike scheme. It is roughly divided into the following directions. The first direction is the art direction, such as placing art installations in public places, or performing performance art in public places. The second direction is the projection and broadcast direction. Because we have participated in workshops on projection technology, we thought of projecting on public buildings to express our views. For example, projecting the countdown for species extinction, London ’s future vision or future postcards, etc., or projecting future news broadcast screens, etc. The third is the funeral direction. We thought it would be very interesting to hold a funeral for the animals. The fourth is online promotion. What we want in this direction is to create filters and posters to be posted on social media to attract users' attention and repost, to evoke people's awareness of the extinction of species.

Our 12-person large group was regrouped at this time. Pat, Tonicha ,Jae and me were responsible for the projection and broadcast direction. Our next step is to perfect and realize this direction. The feedback we get is. The title of our projection is more important than the number, and we need to carefully consider the content of the projection. The time and place of projection are also very worthy of consideration.
