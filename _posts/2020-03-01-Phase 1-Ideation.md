I was very surprised when I got this project. Before I came to the UK, I knew very little about Extinction Rebellion. Many reports in China are actually very negative. Because we do not have a culture of protest and march, people often think of them as a group of fanatics doing very extreme and stupid things. 

But last semester we read an article about leverage point. John showed us how XR used this to pressure the police to force the police to pressure the government to promote upward reform. I found that their actions are actually very smart. It turned out that there was also a lot of knowledge in the protest. I started to have a lot of expectations for this project. The brief we got was to arouse people's awareness of the species losses. I find it very interesting and I feel very excited.

This time I was in a group with Ana, Jiayi and Riezan. Before XR people introduced their brief, we had a very purposeless discussion at the beginning. Riezan thought of the idea of using human-sized animal puppets, and wanted to give animals a chance to express their voices in public. I also like this idea very much, but I think of another direction. What I thought of was to make the animal puppets surrounded by humans in a crowded street and they pushed around by humans. My idea comes from the work of Daniel-Rozin's Penguin Mirror, where the roles of humans and animals are completely reversed. We also thought that it might be possible to make a giant puppet like a Trojan horse to attract people's attention. The topics we are discussing at this time are very random, and have not been verified by research and experiments, but only as a function of divergent thinking.

After the XR people introduced the brief, we chatted with them for a while. We began to feel that this project may need a lot of work, so we thought of combine our three groups tp a large group to promote this project together, so as to ensure that the output is relatively complete. They also strongly support this idea. Our idea is that everyone can come up with ideas together, and then we can regroup into groups if we refine the direction.

The next day, we got together and talked about the idea of the project. We took out a piece of paper, recorded everyone's existing ideas on this piece of paper, and then looked at whether we could contact each other and diverge, and then came up with some small experiments that we could try.

At that time, many wild animals died because of forest fires that were difficult to extinguish in Australia. XR organized members to protest in front of the Australian embassy. We saw this news on social media, and then we thought it was a good opportunity for us to understand the protest, and we decided to observe it.

We came up with some interview questions, and then divided all the team members into two types of roles: observation and interview. The objects of observation are participants, bystanders and the media. And lists some questions to ask.

It is a pity that the day of the protest was a working day and it was already the second march held that week. The actual number of participants was not large, but we still visited some of the participating people.

Carol made a very good presentation video.

After that, we decided to make a physical model to show how different aspects of human activity pollute and destroy the environment. In the presentation on Monday, we showed the contents, pictures and this model of our investigation in the parade.
