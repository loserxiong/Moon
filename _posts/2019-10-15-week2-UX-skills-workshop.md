### Week2-1 UX Skills Workshop 1

The topic for the first workshop was "interviewing, analysing and coding schemes". The whole workshop contains four parts, interview, transcript, coding schemes and keeping track of research.

To start with, Our teacher showed us a picture of the process of conducting a interview.

She introduced to us some interview tips.

1. Ask ''why''(to better understand the need)  "Tell me about the last time you__''
2. Encourage stories
3. Look for inconsistences
4. Pay attention to nonverbal cues
5. Don't suggest answers to your question
6. Ask questions neutrally. Not:"what do you like about buying gifts for your spouse?"
7. Don't ask binary questions(answer can only be one thing or the other)unless absolutely necessary.
8. Be prepared to record(take notes/photos)



Next, we talked about some key interview questions(adjust for your own project)

1. Intro&Screener: introduce yourself and project- see if person relates to it
2. what are you trying to get done/achieve- Gather goal and context
3. How/when/where do you currently do this?- Analyse workflow
4. What could be better about how you do this?- Find opportunities
5.  5 why - ask "why" (or similar) repeatedly to get to the bottom of the matter



During the workshop, we also did some practice about how to conduct intro yourself-intro project-build rapport process. Here is the example.

"Hi, good afternoon. We are students from LCC, user experience design. We are now working on a project which aim to help the blind people and their guide dog. Would you mind helping us by answering some questions? Do you mind if I record this conversation? (If no) You don't need to worry about your privacy, this interview is only for our project research needs. So, how are you today?......." 

We also talked about the right methods of writing a transcript. The transcript includes context, verbatim transcript and observation made by the researcher.

The background and context stand for the name of participant, profile and time. The observation should includes non-verbal observation and any other note from the researcher.

The above link is a perfect example of how to conduct a research systematically with Trello.

As a UX student, interview skills is really important and essential. I hope I can apply them to my upcoming project.
