Next, we started to try to develop our ideas. We decided the content of the shooting through discussion. The film started with a news reporter, and then switched to breaking news scenes. We initially set two news scenes. The first is that the future seabed is full of trash and no fish. The second is that the shelves of future pharmacies are empty, because there are not enough plants as raw materials.

This is the storyboard I drawed in the pharmacy scene.

We later wanted to test the feasibility of this solution, so we rented a photography studio to try to shoot. At the opening stage of the breaking news, I was responsible for filming and radio. After that, I also acted as an actor under the sea. Haha. This is a new and interesting experience. We used a green screen to facilitate the buttoning. We even used multiple lights to simulate the feeling of a news room, and we also used professional sound-receiving equipment. Unexpectedly, as a UX student, one day we need to use these tools to do projects, which is very new.

After that, we went to the place where XR was to show them our progress at this stage.

They gave positive comments on the work done by our group. They said it was a very good direction to make people laugh. We can make more attempts to enrich its content. At the same time, I also agreed to the next step of thinking that we want to anthropomorphize animals.

After finishing the mid-term presentation, our next goal is to refine and improve our idea. Let him be a whole. We thought of shooting animals at the zoo. Then the idea of dubbing them later.

One day after that, I, pat, amber and Jae went to the zoo to take pictures. We mainly shot a lot of isolated pictures of endangered animals. We will hold the microphone as if interviewing them. We have shot a lot of original material. We also took pictures of reporters exploring the habitat of animals, although this did not appear in our final picture.

After that, we rented a photography studio again. Our idea this time was to use the news in various languages around the world to broadcast breaking news to reflect the seriousness of the matter. We invited the students we know who speak various languages to broadcast this news. Under the repetition of various languages, the effect is much more convincing than before.
