After that, we found that the mental health of children during the outbreak seemed largely ignored. They are also the oldest people staying at home during the epidemic. We couldn't help wondering what kind of changes have taken place in children's psychology during this time, so we made it clear that our target users this time, we want to design a system to help understand and improve the psychological state of children during the epidemic.

We want to let children participate without pressure through play. We searched for some related cases, and we discussed at the beginning about how to get the child's mental state. We hope to use non-digital methods because children have spent too much time on digital products. We thought of mailing a physical kit to children and letting them play and participate, and then let parents help us collect and upload.

Zain drew a storyboard based on our vision.

I was responsible for drawing a sketch of the product. This product is a hexagonal box. There are two layers, the first layer is the tool layer. Our vision is to include 9 colors of pencils and erasers. The second layer is the card layer. There are five cards in it. Our assumption is that there are five patterns on the five cards, and children can create randomly according to these five patterns.

I also modeled the product.

After that. I also drew a picture of how parents interact online after painting.

According to our assumption, this is a research tool, which is voluntarily participated by the family. After the child completes, the parent uploads the child’s work. After that, he can see how other children use color to express their mood and how other children use it. Different colors express the same mood. Experts can obtain these data to help analyze and compare the mental state of children.
