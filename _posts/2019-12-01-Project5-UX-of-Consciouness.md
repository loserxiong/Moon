### UX of Consciousness

Partner: Tanvi, Erick, Lea

For the final project of this term, we were asked to design an experience that explores the nature of the consciousness.

We all had bad sleep experience more or less. Tanvi said she was interested in the lucid dream and sleep paralysis these topics. We came to an agreement to start working form that.

Since all these symptoms happened in the bed, we chose bedroom for the artefact analysis process. We found that the bedroom environment can be divided into five aspects, which are control of light, control of sound, control of temperature, control of comfort and control of smell. We made a graph of these include all the related objects.

Next, we asked people about their stories about lucid dream and sleep paralysis to do the story-telling.

We found that nearly all the people had lucid dream before. At the same time, only very few people had sleep paralysis. In addition to nightmares, people also dream about happy things in lucid dreams. The most interesting part for the lucid dream is that when you are in a dream, you are in a unconscious state. But something in your dream can make you aware of you are now in a dream like mirror or something that makes you feel abnormal. When you turn into a conscious state, you can control your dream in a way. Just like you are playing virtual reality games.

I thought it was great if we can present the transform process between the unconscious state and conscious state. I suggested to make two spaces. one stands for unconscious state, everything looks just as they are. The other one stands for conscious state, the objects there are wired according to your imagination. We set up a dream where someone wants to murder you. the participants need to pick something like pan, chopstick from their unconscious state and transform them into swords, hammers to defend themselves in the conscious state. We made several props for participants to choose. Our results may look more like a performance, But we think it's a good way to recreate the experience when you realize you are  in a lucid dream.
