For this project, we were asked to design an artefact that  that express experimental quality of the gravity. To start with, we browse some related artefact about the gravity to generate some ideas. We also did some brainstorming.

An artefact named Phalanstery Module caused our thinking. It tries to treat any face as ground. It is a reflection of zero-gravity environment. We aware that the placement in a room only works in the case of the centre of gravity is facing down. Also, the interior layout of the building is resulted from the gravity. We can simply just put a exit on the roof if there is no gravity at all. Then the furniture idea came up to our mind. In our opinion, the gravity shaped the form of the furniture and also how people arranged their furniture. We are more interested in how people arrange their furniture rather than how the furniture is designed.

So we want to take a close look at how people interact with their indoor furniture. And we went to IKEA to observe and did the behaviour mapping. We chose a place that contains four rooms and saw the objects that people touch and the time they interacted with it. And we made a behavioural  mapping based on the observation. We used yarn to represent each people’s route and the location and the size of the ball to represent the place and the time they spent on it. We noticed that people were more likely to touch objects below than above. They will also spent a lot of time on sofas、chair and beds where they can support themselves.

As you can see, The interaction in IKEA is strongly gravity based. people seldom touch the object above which is part of the truth that is hard to reach. 

So we come up with an idea that we can totally change the arrangement of a room to let people feel wired so as to know their perception of gravity have already shaped by the furniture.  

Before we carry out this project, we used body storming to simulate this situation. We imagine a scene of getting up, washing and going out in a gravity-inverted environment. We simulate the floating cups, floating clothes and other daily supplies, which can provide better guidance for our final outcome.

We also discussed about the form of the presentation. Some group members thought we can make the room feel like floating, others think we should arrange the room upside down. Finally we come up with a conclusion that a floating environment is more like a space atmosphere, which is too clutter, objects are not related to each other. Little prototype were made to test our idea. It turns out to work properly. I came up with an idea that we should unify the colour of all object instead of their real colour so that we can have some sense of mystery.

We first turned to 3D workshop to paint the object to white and see how it works. White objects really don't look like objects on our planet. Then we bought some daily supplies like papers, garbage bin, plates, forks and we also made some furniture like shelf, shoebox to decorate a small room. The experience in this room forms our finial outcome.

In the presentation, we gained some of the feedbacks from our classmates. We understood that our work is a bit lack of creativity since we just simply turned the room upside down. And we can consider use more media like sound and light to bring a more immersive experience.
