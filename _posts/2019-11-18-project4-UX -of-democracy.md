For this project, we were asked to design an experience that address the democratic process. And we are supposed to use two distinct research methods; Literature review and prototyping. 

First of all, We decided to read some articles and books separately and discuss later. For me, I was strongly interested in the  role of the media in democracy. I watched "the great hack" movie and read report about the Cambridge Analytic scandal. Never have I  thought  social media could be used in  democratic election like that. I raised my interest in this topic in  group discussion.

We got several directions, like electoral system, voting process. But we came to an agreement that how the media creates particular narratives and stories that they feed through to the public to shift opinion is a interesting topic to explore.

Through researching, we found out the three major media that were used for propaganda and to shit people's opinions are newspaper, television and social media. We wanted to make a prototype to reflect how these media can influence people.

I came up with an idea that uses different colours of light to be superimposed to produce different colours. We use a tube as the main body. Three plates are evenly inserted in the middle of the tube. The colours of this three plates are red, yellow, and blue. Theses plates symbols three media mentioned above. The light reflects different colours when pass through different amounts of plates. You will find that the white light passes through the three cardboards in turn and turns into a very deep colour, so as to signify the influence of the media.

Then, we move on to our final ideas. At first, we want to make something that we can manipulate the ideas of the whole class without their attention. But this is not ethical and we must get consent before doing so. So we skipped this idea.

After that, we thought we could pick one media and use as a sample to really show how media change people's opinion. Newspaper  become our choice, which owns the longest history and easy to find report about certain event. Felix make a list of the newspapers that considered to have a fixed political stance, such as Guardian, Daily mirror and Sun. And we we chose five topic, which is drugs, Cambridge Analytic, Brexit and Scotland independence. Then we found the related report from these newspaper organizations and see how they  narrated and worded. We came up to an idea that we can make a newspaper that reflect totally different opinions in a time using the same methods we use in the prototype.

Based on these report, we wrote two different versions of the report that reflect different political positions as well as some interesting stories about our classmates.

Next, because we all finish the screen-printing workshop, we thought of using red and blue ink to print the two version on paper and make red and blue filter glasses for viewers so that they can see totally different contents when they put different glasses on.

We started to typeset them in newspaper format and print them on laser films. Then we went through several process to make the frame.

Unfortunately, when we continue to print process. We were told there is not enough time for us to print. We are so disappointed since we almost finish. We had to change our plan from printing by our own to machine printing.  We end up using machine to print a newspaper with two versions in two colours. This newspaper is just like what we read daily. It will only show you what the author wants to show you, subtly changing your mind.

The presentations turns out to be pretty great. When you put on red filter glasses, you can only see the positive news. While putting on the blue glasses, things are quite the contrary. It's just a pity we didn't have enough time to print the newspaper by ourselves.
