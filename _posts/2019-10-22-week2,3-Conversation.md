Week 2-3 Project2 Conversation

For this project, we were asked to design a conversation between a human user and a machine. I worked with Erick, Zain and Ann.

At first, we had some debate about the definition of machine. Ann think small objects such as table, chair and also animals like rabbit could also be defined as machine. But the rest of us just didn't want our project to be too abstract. So we move on to do some brainstorming to find out the fields that may have some opportunities.

After that, we thought the tube station would be a idea place to observe because there are all kinds of people. So we went there and observe using AEIOU method.

But the results turned out differently. This does not bring us much inspiration.  So we are diverging from tube station to traffic lights. And then we thought of how blind people cross the street. Now the plan of blind people and their guide dog appeared in our mind. We tried to create a machine between guide dog and blind people. We wanted to figure out if there is any problem for blind people communicating with their guide dog.

To start with, we drew several storyboard to express our ideas.

We came out some questions and made a interview scheme.

We searched on the internet and found that there is a organization that training guide dogs. So we decided to pop up and do some observations and even interviews.

When we arrived there, we tried to talk to the staff there and we were told that the building is not open to the public. So we just found a coffee shop across the street and grabbed a cup of coffee and observed if there is blind people coming with their guide dog.  And we observed there for whole afternoon and came out with nothing. We didn't even meet one guide dog. We have to dropped this idea.

So our group back to the tube station again. We decided to go to a bigger station and find something new this time. We did AEIOU again.

Through the research of this time, we noticed that people at the station mainly interact with the big screen. They will keep staring at the screen to check the information with their head up. So we thought we could make some interesting conversation between the human and the screen.

So we  drew some storyboard again to  show the idea.

After that, we used the method called "speed dating". We presented all the storyboard to our users and gathered their feedbacks to our ideas. So we can choose our plan and iterate.

![project2-15.jpg](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/OcghEyNFnpAZDik.jpg)

The idea about the conversation with the building one gained a lot of positive feedbacks. So we decided to move on that.

As you can see from this two pictures. The centre of the station is the busy area. But the space around the wall is quite leisure. And instead of sitting on the chair, some people even more prefer laying on the wall and playing with their phones. So we decided to make a conversation between the people and the wall to let them feel the connection and the communication with the building.

![project2-18.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/5BTNsHi4e3owQPx.png)

As we see from this picture. We wanted to choose  heat maps to express our concepts. When people lay on the wall for a while, the colour on the wall will change according to the time they spend. Different figures will have overlap to form a new figure. 

For this project, we spent a lot of time on researching and discussing. We had much debate about the definition of the machine. And we changed our plan because we can't find blind people to do the speed dating. But the final result is quite satisfactory. Hope I can be more efficient next time.
