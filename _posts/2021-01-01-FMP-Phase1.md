# Topic Exploration

The coronavirus epidemic is certainly something that everyone needs to face nowadays. When we were thinking about our final major project, we quickly agreed on the idea of designing for an epidemic-related topic.
Since Alex and I are both travelers and our vacation plans were cancelled as a direct result of the epidemic, we started our project with travel.

After deciding on a topic, we tried to explore the general direction we wanted to continue by searching the literature. We started by conducting a series of desktop research on travel behavior.

We have found that social media has now made it very easy to share travel experiences and that more and more people tend to seek travel inspiration through the posts of others. The data shows that 76% of people will post photos of their vacation on social media. At the same time 45% will be frustrated by the lack of access to travel information online.

And because social media represents a personal identity and lifestyle, traveling can be an enviable personal quality. Some tourists are now flocking to hotspots to take photos just to impress their friends on instagram, and destinations are also offering tour packages where visitors can take as many glamorous photos as they need. The data shows that 36% of people will upload better photos than they actually look, in order to make others jealous and to compete with others who have done the same thing.

It seems a large percentage of people travel not for personal pleasure, but to be admired and praised by an online audience. There is even a trend of "punchline travel", which has been reported in many media outlets.

We have drawn a diagram of "punchline travel" and the locations that such travelers love to visit.

Inspired by the popular phenomenon of photo-travel or punchline travel, we wanted to critically examine this phenomenon and think about the real meaning of travel. We named it "Click" because the word itself has the meaning of taking pictures.

We communicated our ideas in tutorials and got a lot of feedback, first of all whether we wanted to change the problem or to communicate the phenomenon so that people would realize that the problem was not clearly expressed. Then they felt that I started from the epidemic but didn't relate to it very closely, and that most people don't choose to go on a trip in the current conditions. Also, the issue of the project not being critical enough was raised, and the teachers felt it was more of a storytelling than a design. The lack of challenge was also a huge problem. Tutor suggested that we try to define the age group/social class we wanted to focus on first, and then we could expand on it.

After this, we discussed the topic again. Perhaps because our theme was too broadï¼Œso it was not challenging enough and not clear enough. So we decided to take a step back. A step back from travel and focus on the daily travel aspects of people in the epidemic. After this. We started to explore the issues related to daily travel.
