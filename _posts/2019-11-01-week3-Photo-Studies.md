### Week3 UX Skills Workshop photo studies

For this week of collaborate project. We studied the method ''Photo Studies". It's definition is invite the participant to photo-document aspects of his or her life and interactions, providing the designer with visual, self-reported insights into user behaviours and priorities. Photo studies are common in exploratory research as a method for understanding the world of users, particularly when engaging in territory unfamiliar to the designer.

Within the group, we pick the question that how light informs us about space. So we split into groups to shot the object that is related to this topic.

I took a picture of the gradient and think the gradient help us understand the space. Other group members also hold the same opinion.

I think the photo studies doesn't use it in this way.  We went to the wrong side. Now I understand.
