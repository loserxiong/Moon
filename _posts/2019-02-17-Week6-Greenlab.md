For this project, my partner is Masha, Pat and Amber. We were asked to deisgn a product or a service using  sustainable material they developed.

To start with, Andrew showed us some materials they have. I've only bought two products made from sustainable materials beforeï¼ŒRunning shoes by adidas and a cup. I had really limited knowledge about how the sustainable materials produces. 

To be honest, I was shocked by the variety of materials they were able to produce. In my mind, I used to regard sustainbale material as a really complicated material that must be made from big companies. Now I realise that it is not that hard and we even are able to make them in a home labotory. And he also showed us a online material library they published on the website. They also published the ingredients and steps needed to make it. They also show a recycle circle of earthworm. The little worms can decompose coffee grounds to soil for growing plants, which is amazing!

After that, we got a chance to experience to make a sustainable material by ourselves. We used glycerol and agar agar to make this bioplastic. It looks a lot like the agar agar that you see in the lab, but it has good strength and ductility.

For the other day, we got a chance to make another material and add some color on it. After that, we start to work on our project. We reached an agreement that we want to design something that is useful and evironmetal friendly. We create some patterns on the material we made. Based on its material properties, we thought of something that is soft. I was interested in making a hloder and wallet. Because a wallet needs a  beautiful textile. And we can sew multiple layers togheter to make it looks layered and stronger. And Amber thought of passport holder and watch band. We agreed that all of them are good ideas, but we wanted to see if we can go further and make it our valuable. So we started to search some examples to give us some inspirations. Amber find a biodegradable bottle made from algae by others. The biodegradable bottle retains its shape while it is filled with water but slowly starts to decompose when it is empty. I think it's a great idea because it's a brilliant response to plastic bottles that are hard to break down. This inspired us to think about products that people don't use for a long time.

So we decided to continue our idea of making a wallet but is recycleable. We used spirulina to create good patterns on the bioplastics. And then we left it overnight for it to form the shape. For the next day, we cutted it out into different shapes and picked out the most good looking pieces and sew them toghether to make this wallet.

As you can see, the wallet has a really nice look whichl looks quite similar to the landscape painting. It has two sides and several layers, which is ideal to hold your carders.

Besides, we also thought of the ways to let customers participate in this sustainable business and make their our contributions. Because this material will decompose after a year, we create a recycle mechanism. When their wallets break, they can send their old one back and receive a new one for free. They can also choose a new pattern so that they don't need to consume any non-renewable materials for the wallet which is good for the environment.

We also create a food package that contains special vitamins. When you wrap your good with our package, it adds vitamins to the food. It is quite conceptual, but it's a direction worth thinking about. We also made a prototype to demonstrate this idea.

We were all really proud of the prodcut we made and spent a decade shooting nice pics for them. It is a really interesting collaborate project.

What I learn from this project is that making a sustainable material is not that hard as I used to think. We can easily make it at our home. I definitely will try to use this kind of material for my future project. 

It was the first time for me to cooperate with these team members, and I think we got along very well.
