# Discussion+Conclusion

After this, we further deepened the concept and designed the shape, then modeled and rendered. A physical product was manufactured using 3D printing.

Once we had the physical product, we got several users to actually simulate a communication scenario using this device, recorded and compiled their feedback.

“The experience of using this tube to connect with other people is very new”  Among all the feedback, this was their first reaction.

One person said. "Using the physical pavilion to connect and communicate made me really feel like we were really connected, and also the presence of the tube made both parties clearly aware of communicating with each other, the sound was transmitted directly into my mask and the user could focus on understanding what the other person was saying."
"It's like a separate ZOOM meeting where I can communicate with each other smoothly without having to think about privacy issues."
"I think it's a cool experience, when I see he's connecting with someone else, I know he's talking and I choose not to bother them."
"I think this is a very safe experience, both in terms of preventing outbreaks and in terms of the security of communication"

Some people talked about "I think it's a very critical experience. Using the tube itself seemed very awkward because you need to carry the tube all the time while using it to connect to other people. But it really worked, and it was wonderful to have conversations in the mask where the voices felt amplified. I was able to understand the other person's semantics and tone of voice very well, which is a huge help for socializing."

The act of using a physical hose to connect two people seems a bit comical, but that's what we wanted to challenge. Two parties wearing masks and communicating only through the upper part of their expressions are also awkward and abrupt. The tube plays more of a tentacle role to transmit and amplify the volume and tone of the other party, using the sound enhancement to compensate for the lack of facial information and distance.

From the feedback of users, our devices are able to trigger their thinking about communication issues, and with the development of network technology, wireless seems to have become a new trend. Wireless headphones, wireless charging, and communication between people has become more senseless. The use of such a non-digital physical connection is the hope to step out of the box and cause reflection on the communication problems caused by the epidemic.

## Conclusion

In summary, drawing on the theoretical work of Ron, William, and Sabrina, my research attempts to explore the impact of the new post-epidemic normal on communication styles using a speculative design perspective, and to further explore the design of communication tools in the post-epidemic era. My research reveals that humans, as social animals, are born to interact with other people, and as masks and social distance measures have been proven and accepted as very effective means of mitigating the epidemic and are being used on a large scale, the new normal of daily protection has led to communication barriers and impacts on pre-existing social behaviors. The main anxiety was the difficulty of being easily misunderstood and having complete access to and understanding of each other's information. From the research I came to the general conclusion that soon new changes in the way of communicating under the new normal would be inevitable. The project ended with the design of a communication device that accurately transmits and amplifies information while achieving protection, a prediction and exploration of the future.

The project also had limitations, firstly, the interviewees were mainly young people of a limited age range, and there were shortcomings in data collation and feedback collection. At the same time, after the physical product is produced, feedback and testing should also be introduced to multiple age groups to obtain more diverse views, so as to be more in-depth and critical.

Finally, after exploring how physical devices can improve existing communication methods, this project has potential value for future communication device design. We tried to use solids as a medium to transmit and enhance sound to compensate for the existing lack of it. However, there is room for more extensive exploration in the choice of materials and the way they are connected. The complexity of the connection also needs to be addressed for application in everyday life. In short, we hope that the potential problems of the post-epidemic era can be fully understood and that more communication methods can be applied to help us communicate better.
