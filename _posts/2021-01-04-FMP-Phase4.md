# Discussion+Design

As described in the literature review, the epidemic may not be over for a long time to come, and we started with a prediction of its year. We set this product to exist in the next 5-10 years time frame. After that we set two potential use scenarios for it, namely exhibition viewing and business processing scenarios, representing acquaintance socialization and stranger socialization, respectively. This became the starting point of our design.

In the prototyping phase, we first used the existing product analysis method. Because we wanted to explore a device that would have a protective effect while ensuring smooth communication. So we studied existing protective devices and compared their strengths and weaknesses. Some design solutions or prototypes were also taken into account. By analyzing these products, we were able to integrate and improve our own solutions. The figure below shows some of our existing analyses.

We chose products such as masks, protective masks and protective clothing for the daily protective products that people use frequently. We found that these products are all function-first products that serve the purpose of preventing bacteria from entering the body. These colors do not belong to daily life and appear very abruptly in life frequently. At the same time, these products are all uniform in size, and different people have different experiences when using them. The marks strangled by the masks become a universal mark. In addition, they are all seen as disposable products or quick consumables, playing more of an add-on than a necessity.

After this, we sketched many prototypes experimentally. It came in all shapes and forms from helmets to visors. We used these sketches and storyboards to test them on users.

According to user feedback, we came to the following conclusions.

1. the uniqueness of the shape/styling that is different from existing objects is more in line with the respondents' expectations for future protective devices.
2. users do not feel that using wireless signals to communicate represents a future scenario. The technology already exists and is easy to imagine.

After that, we brainstormed how such a device should be connected to solve our problem.
We found inspiration from a childhood game called Pass the Mic. It uses the principle of solid sound wave vibration transmission. When the sound source vibrates at one end of the microphone, the physical structure of the paper cup effectively gathers the sound and reduces its diffusion, and finally passes through the middle string into the paper cup at the other end. Sound is produced by the vibration of an object, and sound is a fluctuation of material vibration that needs to be transmitted through a medium in order to be heard. Now I can still recall the amazing feeling of playing this game as a child and hearing the sound from the other end passed through the paper cup. A similar principle of connection is also found in the movie *Avatar*, in which Avatar connects and exchanges information with plants, animals and other creature through a structure in the form of a "braid" on his body. We felt that this approach would reduce physical contact and isolate viruses from a protective point of view, and that using physical objects as a medium would also be useful for transmitting sound and facilitating communication. So we designed our final solution based on this.

As you can see from the storyboard in the picture, this device consists of a mask with a retractable connecting tube. There are two typical scenarios.
You need to wear the mask and carry the connection tube before going out every day.

1. Acquaintance socialization: after arriving at the agreed location, the connecting tube is attached to a friend’s mask. The physical characteristics of the connection tube ensure that the sound is transmitted clearly and can be freely adjusted in distance. After this, the two people can communicate and socialize freely, such as watching exhibitions, etc. 
2. Stranger social: to the bank and other offices is to connect the connection tube to the corresponding window bayonet, so that you can communicate with the salesman normal.

Here is the sketch we made based on this concept.
