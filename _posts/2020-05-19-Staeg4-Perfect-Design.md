Partner：Zain, Ivy, Kai

In the final stage, we continue to improve and deepen our design.

Zain designed the outer packaging of this box. The color scheme is very fresh and childlike, in line with the children's aesthetic.

I continued to improve the design of the card. The result of our last iteration is that each card has six questions, distributed in 6 corners, and it will guide the children to draw step by step. Then 5 cards represent 5 scenes, two natural scenes, two social scenes, and the last one is a future scene. They are forest, sea, park, school and space.

Kai rarely expressed willingness to take charge of making the box.

In addition, we also found children to verify our prototype.

This is a summary of our final product.

Using this form of drawing, children are indeed very easy to accept and very willing to participate in the experiment.
