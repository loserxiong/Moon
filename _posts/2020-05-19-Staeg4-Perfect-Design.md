In the final stage, we continue to improve and deepen our design.

Zain designed the outer packaging of this box. The color scheme is very fresh and childlike, in line with the children's aesthetic.

I continued to improve the design of the card. The result of our last iteration is that each card has six questions, distributed in 6 corners, and it will guide the children to draw step by step. Then 5 cards represent 5 scenes, two natural scenes, two social scenes, and the last one is a future scene. They are forest, sea, park, school and space.

Kai rarely expressed willingness to take charge of making the box.

In addition, we also found children to verify our prototype.

This is a summary of our final product.

![截屏2020-06-29 上午1.42.51.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/06/29/XOANz7svhE8CFiU.png)I think our final product is a very interesting thing, especially after testing the children, you can really feel the difference in mood reflected by the children’s paintings, although we can’t verify to what extent this can It helps to analyze the psychology of children, but we strictly refer to the experiments of psychology and believe that it can help psychologists make certain judgments. Using this form of drawing, children are indeed very easy to accept and very willing to participate in the experiment.
