For this week's project, Mr Tyler from Washington University was in charge of this session. My partner is Ling, Kai and Pat. It was my first time to work with them.

First, we were asked to review the last three seminar articles we read before. And Tyler talked about a terminology called prehension. And we were asked to make a diagram of a prehending phone, used by a (human) user focus on one phone prehension. I was really struggled at this point because I just can't make sense of it.  From my personal view, I think the meaning of this terminology is close to attraction and affordance. I asked some of my friends, Everyone has a completely different understanding. So I am still confused now.

After that, each group was given a object. We got a wig. We were asked to map objects relations and reconsider it in a post-humanism context.

We started to analyse the wig. We think it is a tool for identity. Most of the time, people use wig to change their appearance. After that, we traced back to the raw material of wig. We found that wig is made by polyester. It needs acid and chemicals to produce, which is not environment-friendly. A wig make people look better, but it takes a lot of chemicals to make it. 

We also made a small prototype to illustrate the function. We used several disposable cup. For the first one, we drawed a triangle on it. We drew different colors on the other cups. When I take one of those and put it on the first cup, it will show different figures, such as an ice cream or a compass.

So, we decided to map this connection. Our model have three layers, which is production,usage and  after used.

For the next few days, we moved on and try to deisgn a prototype from post-human perspective. Wigs are only designed to satisfy human aesthetics. At that time, the appearance of creatures should be adapted to the living environment and have the function to help them survive. An idea of creating a post-human creature came to our mind. 

Basically, we collected a bunch of animals organs and print them out and cut them out. So we created eyes, hairs, ears, noses and mouses five piles.

Next step is to ask five volunteers to create a creature based on their own preference. For this stage, the creature is 100% designed by human with the aesthetic characteristics of human beings.

The following step is to ask these 5 volunteers to form a group and they were given a scene or future environment. Each of them only had one chance to pick an organ to create this creature. So the final creature is totally random and can symbolize the idea of post-human design. We want to use these two steps to compare the differences between human design and post-human design.

It turned out that Tyler quite liked our outcome and so do we. We carefully analyzed this brief and work it out step by step and also keep it simple to let others understand.

It is a nice collaborate experience.
