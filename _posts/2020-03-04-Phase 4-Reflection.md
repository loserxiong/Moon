After this, we also participated in the parade of other groups together. Our parade consists of several parts, the first is the funeral part. We carried the coffin and walked all the way from the school to the council. We all put on animal masks, and at the same time there were animal growls in the coffin. Along the way, we have attracted the attention of many passers-by. After arriving at our destination, we placed the coffin directly at the door of the council, and then placed flowers on the coffin to show our condolences. The second part is the installation part. We also put a device we made in front of the coffin, which is a tombstone with buttons. It says, are you willing to reset all this? This reflects our attitude towards species losses. If you can choose to do it again, how would you choose? This has also attracted the attention of many people. Many people pressed the device without hesitation. I think the effect of the whole game is still very good. Many people stopped to watch, and even some people were very interested in it, and discussed our project in depth with us.

This project was totally unexpected to me. Because I have never been in contact with organizations like XR, let alone the protest. The whole thing is a new experience.

But frankly speaking, I feel that I still struggled especially after the whole project. The first point is that the pace of 12 people discussing the project together is too strange. Although I admit that 12 people working together can do the project very well. But everyone's opinions in the project cannot be fully listened to. I always feel that we didn't agree on something and moved directly to the next stage. I always feel very strange. what? Have we all agreed on this plan? In teamwork, I always define myself as that relatively active role, but this time I feel very passive. Because I don’t have enough knowledge about XR and the protest, so many times I just don’t insist on my point of view, but this directly leads me to some resistance to the project because some plans just  cannot convince me. In the later period, I did not participate very actively, of course, this is  my responsibility. And I think that 12 people are sometimes difficult to unify the direction. Sometimes some team members do something spontaneously, and other members will praise this behavior, so that I am embarrassed to ask her why she choose  this method, because I think it is not appropriate  to use this method there. It feels like using this method in order to use this method. I didn't mean to blame any team member. This time, I was working with many people for the first time. I think it was a very interesting experience. But a group of 12 people is very unsuitable for me.

In this project I also tried many new things. For example, it is a very valuable experience to take a video in the studio for the first time, try the protest for the first time, and interview the protesters for the first time. I will say that if I do this project myself, the result will be a completely different output, but it is also a very unique experience to do projects at the rhythm of others.
