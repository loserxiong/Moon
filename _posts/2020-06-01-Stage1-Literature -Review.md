For the project this term, the brief we got was to design a system that can help people who experience uncertainty or anxiety during this time. As we all know, we are now in a very special historical period, and people more or less need to experience a new experience of isolation at home. Everyone's ability to cope with abrupt changes is also different. At this time, a system is needed to help people adapt to this shock. I think this brief has great social value,

After getting the brief, our feeling is that this is a very interesting topic, but we do not have any ideas about its possible form and the target audience. So we decided to read the references first to find some inspiration.

The article I am reading is "The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence". It discusses the impact of isolation on people's mental state. The article points out that 20% of people report anxiety during isolation, 18% report stress, and 18% feel sad. Very few people report that this is a positive feeling. At the same time, the report pointed out that people who have been in isolation for more than 10 days have higher post-traumatic stress symptoms than those who have been isolated for less than 10 days. They also pointed out that the lack of information from public health authorities is the main reason for this pressure, and they are confused about the purpose of isolation.

Another article is: "Social Relationships and Health: The Toxic Effects of Perceived Social Isolation". This article is about when people feel isolated in society, they will enter a self-protection mode, which may help production in the short term, but will increase mortality in the long run. This outdated production mechanism will increase the sensitivity of threats from all sides.

After this, we also collected some cases to help us diverge our thinking. Ivy found a voice-release jewelry called OTO. It collects the pressure output by the human body through biometrics tracking, and converts it into bones to be transmitted to the wearer's voice. The working principle of oto is to generate sound input through the wearer's emotional fusion at different times of the day. This is a very worthy case.

Another very interesting case is the Netflix party, where users can watch netflix online with their friends remotely and chat at the same time.

As another example, we thought of it immediately when we got the brief. That was the Animal crossing  during the outbreak. Our feeling is that this seems to be the perfect solution to this brief. After thinking of this, the idea seemed to be limited at once, and there seemed to be no better solution than it. We later told John this idea. John’s reply was because we happened to be the group of people who were interested in games. Children and seniors might not like that game, and if they didn’t like it, What about the group of people? Then we suddenly realized that there were so many possibilities to face different people.

In the first stage, we mainly conducted literature reviews and case reviews, which gave us a rough impression of the approximate output in our minds. Effectively helped us broaden our thinking.
