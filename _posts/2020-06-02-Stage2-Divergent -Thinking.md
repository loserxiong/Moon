After that, we used Miro for brainstorming and thinking divergence. Our initial idea was to diverge from three aspects, namely intervention, cause and influence. For example, from the direction of influence, we spread to the age group and spread to the struggle of the elderly during the epidemic. We also paid attention to the impact on mental health, for example, the reduction of contact with friends will cause the relationship to change. In addition, the impact on physical health is also a point worth considering. This is the most direct aspect of the impact, because people cannot go outdoors to exercise. In terms of intervention, we begin to diverge from play, attention transfer, connection, sexual satisfaction, sensory experience and inspiration. Coloring books is an intervention in the game.

After that, we picked a few interesting directions and started brainstorming separately. These are the directions of smell, sex and intimacy, music, relationships and exercise. I hope we focus more on the demand side than the product. I am responsible for this part of the relationship. The first thing I thought about was the tension in the relationship caused by different perceptions of the virus. I found that everyone has different levels of attention to viruses because of their different experiences. There is no universal way for people to understand each other's perception. At the same time, I also thought about the tension between people being racially discriminated against because they were wearing masks. Then I also thought of the new neighborhood relationship that was born during the epidemic. For example, there is a community in Italy, where neighbors use musical instrument ensemble on their own balcony. In another news report, a neighbor upstairs poured wine downstairs.

After summarizing several directions, we discussed these several mind maps and extracted several interesting directions. We have a total of three major points. The first one is about the perception of new coronary pneumonia by people around us. Anxiety with different scales, the second is anxiety about wanting to satisfy intimacy. The third is thinking about online courses, including feeling anxious about coping with children and anxiety about not adapting to new learning methods.

After determining the three general directions, we began a more targeted divergence and then raised four "HMW" questions. They are 1. If we can create a system to understand how others view the virus? 2. If we can create a way for others to understand how we view the virus 3. If we can create for the neighborhood A new way of communication. 4. If we build a system of supervision and flogging, it can see the learning time between students, learning tasks and so on.

I thought of a way to help promote the communication of neighbourhood. The method is for everyone to get the weekly theme online, and then they can decorate or place corresponding items next to the window. Then each one can appreciate the works of the neighbor windows，which is a weak connection method to relieve anxiety

This is the story board I drew.
