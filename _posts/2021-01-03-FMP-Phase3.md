# Research+Ideation

After we have the initial conclusion, we conducted research on real-life users to further verify our conjecture. We used user interviews and observation methods to conduct the research. We tried to cover as many age groups and scenarios as possible.

## User interview

Many of my friends around me have experienced very long periods of wearing masks, and some are used to such a normal. I conducted user interviews with them, asking them about their views on daily protection and the troubles they have.
This is the outline of the user interviews we conducted, which focused on the following four areas.

1. What is your opinion about the current epidemic leading to protective measures?
2. What kind of changes do you think the current epidemic has brought to your life? Positive or negative?
3. In what aspect do you think the epidemic has changed you the most? What is the most serious impact?
4. What kind of changes do you think the continuation of the epidemic will bring to your outings?

In response to the answers we have compiled the chart shown in the figure:

As can be seen, in the user interviews, respondents generally expressed the view that they are more likely to be misunderstood when wearing a mask, mainly because it is difficult to recognize the other person's facial expression when wearing a mask, which causes some trouble in communication, which matches our literature research. In addition, respondents also reported that it was less easy to understand what the other person was saying while wearing a mask and that it was more difficult to communicate.
However, others said that the act of wearing the mask itself made them feel very comfortable, sometimes even eliminating the need to put on makeup.

In response to the question of staying social, one person said he was very positive about this approach because he felt that people were too close to each other before the outbreak. Keeping this distance now would make him feel more at ease. However, most people expressed that social distance had drastically reduced human interaction and made them uncomfortable. Eating in isolation was the activity that received the most feedback on discomfort.

In terms of adapting to the new normal, respondents generally said they did not feel particularly uncomfortable, but still felt that the experience was not friendly enough. The atmosphere can become very awkward when there is a situation where either party is not wearing a mask when talking to themselves and others. It is also difficult to grasp the other party's measure of safe distance. A new balance in interpersonal communication has not yet been established.

For typical users, we have also created user personas to help understand.

## Oberservation

We went offline to actually observe how offline activities based on the principle of social distance are conducted in the current epidemic environment. We tried to go to different public places, including malls, parks, banks, galleries, and other places. This allowed us to understand how people of different age groups adjust and adapt to this environment.
While observing we used the AEIOU rule to help us observe and record ourselves. The picture below shows some of the records we took while making them.

For the off-line field observation aspect, we found that strangers have become more cautious in socializing. Before communicating, both parties will coincidentally keep a distance. After communication, they will go further and keep a normal distance to communicate with each other when they find a need for further communication. In the past, we always saw many people sharing a bench or fitness facilities in the park, but now if someone takes the bench or fitness equipment, the rest will choose to use the rest or choose not to use it. In terms of queuing behavior, people are also accustomed to the huge space between them.

Overall, the sense of disconnection under the mask and the physical barriers to communication, such as the difficulty of distinguishing voices and hearing them clearly, were the most significant negative effects of this new norm.

These effects caused us to think that living with the epidemic will inevitably become the new normal, but at this stage the behavior of the masses wearing protective measures such as masks looks like a half-baked, intermediate state. It also generally creates new problems in communication and exchange. At the same time, such problems are not generally recognized and taken seriously from top to bottom.

So we thought of designing a protective device that could be used in the near future to solve communication problems, based on research, as a way to explore the future of communication. speculative design was our main approach. IKEA, in collaboration with many design studios, has produced a magazine, a catalog. The catalog was about furniture related to the future smart home, which was IKEA's imagination and challenge for the future concept. This inspired us to draw attention to this issue and to think about possible forms of adapting to the new normative devices.
